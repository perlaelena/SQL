#Int this SQL I query a database with multiple tables to find statistics about customers and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID' AND Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT customers.acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers
LEFT INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price 
IN (SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity) * price AS total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum), AVG(quantity * price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT INNER JOIN BIT_DB.Customers
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
